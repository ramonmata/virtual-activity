Virtual Activity
======

#### Simualtes activity in your windows pc

This is a small utility I wrote for fun and because sometimes I needed to do some monitoring something at work, but screen saver was getting in the way.

As you may not know, in the corportate world most of the time you are not allowed to disable windows settings, so Virtual Activity was born!
